# SpriteKit

The SpriteKit framework makes it easy to create high-performance, battery-efficient 2D games. 

With support for custom OpenGL ES shaders and lighting, integration with SceneKit, and advanced new physics effects and animations, you can add force fields, detect collisions, and generate new lighting effects in your games.
